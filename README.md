# La fabrique

Digital toolbox gathering tools, methods, media contents to foster projects.

## Getting Started

*These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.*

### Prerequisites

- ruby 2.4.0
- rails 5.0.1
- postgresql


### Installing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:clairezed/la-fabrique.git
cd la-fabrique
bundle install
cp config/database_example.yml config/database.yml
# Update database.yml to cope with your own database connection credentials
bin/rake db:setup
bin/rake db:seed
rails server
```

Your website should be accessible at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Email notifications will be caught by [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/). Install it if you haven't yet. 

Then, to see the emails sent by the platform, open your web browser at http://localhost:1080 to access the MailCatcher interface.


### Dummy data

If you want to generate 20 fake lightweight tools, you can run : 

```bash
rake seeds:dummy_tools
```

## Running the tests

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rake db:seed
rspec
```

The project could clearly have more tests. Don't hesitate to contribute, I'll be happy to help !

## Deployment
